**Overview:**
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of deep learning models for time series forecasting.

**Current Model Architectures include:**
<ol>
  <li> Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)</li>
  <li>Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)</li>
  <li> Transformers and attention mechanism based models.</li>
</ol>
