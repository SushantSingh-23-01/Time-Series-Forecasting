<h2><b>Overview:</b></h2><br>
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of deep learning models for time series forecasting.

<h3>Current Model Architectures include:</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)</li>
  <li> Recurrent Neural networks (LSTMs& GRUs)</li>
  <li> Transformers and attention mechanism based models.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>The project doesn't aim at obtaining state of the art results but exploring various architectures available in literature.</b>
<br><br>If you end up using files from this repository, a reference would be appreciated.
