**Overview:**
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of deep learning models for time series forecasting.

**Current Model Architectures:**
  - Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
  - Transformers and attention mechanism based models.
The project doesn't aim at obtaining state of the art results but exploring various architectures available in literature.
