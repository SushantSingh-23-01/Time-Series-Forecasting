# Exploring Deep Learning Architectures in Time Series Forecasting

## Overview

This project aims to explore various deep learning architectures used in time series forecasting and benchmark their performance on the **Jenna climate** dataset.

## Objectives
1. To understand and implement different types of neural network architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based networks, and Transformers.
2. To evaluate these models using the Jenna climate dataset.
3. To compare the results for different decoding techniques.

## Project Setup
Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results and Analysis
The results of each model on different forecasting techniques are documented in a separate Jupyter notebook or report, providing insights into the performance of various architectures.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different deep learning architectures for time series forecasting tasks. The code and results can be used as a reference for further research and development.
